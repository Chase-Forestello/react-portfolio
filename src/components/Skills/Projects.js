  GameFace: {
    Title: "GameFace",
    Description: `GameFace is a single-page application social media platform that
 allows gamers to connect with other gamers in order to enhance their
 gaming experience. This project uses HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and a
 small scale SPA JavaScript framework to deliver the front-end. The
 back-end was built in Java using Spring Boot and is served using
 Amazon RDS, and Amazon S3. The relational database consists of
 various datasets to track user activity and implements some custom
 SQL queries which are all served through a robust REST API.
 Utilizing Google authentication, GameFace users are able to create
 and personalize their profile based on platform of choice,
 gamertags, and favorite games through the RAWG API. Additionally,
 GameFace users connect with posts, likes, comments, and highlights
 which are served by the Filestack API. GameFace gives users the
 ability to find gaming partners based on games played, region,
 skill, and play style. Ultimately, GameFace is a networking solution
 that allows users to connect and grow as gamers in a safe and
 inclusive environment.`,
